# CharChat

CharChat is an application written in Java that uses a client-server architecture to allow users to chat with each 
other. The server is able to handle multiple clients at once and the clients are able to send messages to the server
which are then broadcast to all other clients. The server also keeps track of the clients that are currently
connected.

## Purpose

This was a research project for my own personal interest. I wanted to learn more about how sockets work and how they
can be used to create a client-server architecture while also learning more about multi-threading.
